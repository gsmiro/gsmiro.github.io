                <p>I'm a self motivated, quality driven <b>learner</b>...<br>...and in my spare time I also do some software development - mostly when I'm working or at home.</p> <p>I've been a software developer (engineer , programmer or any other definition you can come up with ...) since 2006 having worked in major tech companies - like HP and ADP - and also small startup like environments.</p>
                <p>Although I'm mostly a Java developer I have never settled for a single technology and have always looked to keep up with the latest tools and frameworks, which made me what you can call an all-around software developer. I have a close interest in Javascript in all its flavors - NodeJS, ES6, Babel, Dart, TypeScript, etc... - and mobile development.</p>
